MORSE CODE Y'ALL

Minimalist Keyboard - Text input from a simpler time

Have you ever looked at the keyboard on your phone and been overwhelmed by the dozens of tiny keys? Do you wish that your keyboard supported more non-visual feedback? Do you ever feel patronized by the lack of challenge in your daily text inputting activities?

Fear not because thanks to our new Android custom keyboard, you never have to be burdened with multiple keys again. This minimalist keyboard allows you to live the authentic telegraph experience.  

More specifically, this is a Morse code keyboard with only one button. By using the duration of button presses and the pauses in between, our single button keyboard decodes your rhythmic tapping into actual words and phrases. To ensure an authentic telegraph experience, the key produces genuine beeping with taps. In case you yearn for visual feedback, it also displays the series of dots and dashes you've inputted so far.
